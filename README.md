## App Creation Approach
* I wanted to create an app where friends and families could join closed groups and stay connected through messages and other forms of media.
* The app was designed to mobile, as most of the users would be using their phones to use the app.
* I researched other social platforms to see how other apps functioned, and tried to implement some of those popular conventions in my own way.
* The app was designed to be family friendly and intuitive to use.
* The current version of the application is a vertical slice of what the full-fledged app could be like. To see a list of ideas for what the fully-functioning application could be, see future updates section below.

## Future Updates
1. Making rooms private / invite only.
2. Private 1 on 1 messages.
3. Photo / Video sharing.
4. Like button.
5. Emojis.
6. Show users that are connected.
7. Show when a user is typing.
8. Notifications.
9. Events Calendar.
